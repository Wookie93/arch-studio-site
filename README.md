## Arch Studio multi-page website

Whole project was taken from Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io) (visual design)

I decided to make a project for client which want a static page with fixed content. 
Changes over time will be very small

As a photos magazine I choose cloundinary 

The webiste have:
 - home page:
 - portfolio list page
 - about page
 - contact page

 On the contact page I use:
  - React Leafleat for map
  - Formik for contact form

Here is demo:  https://dynamic-bonbon-592986.netlify.app
